 Bout Maker: MMA Tournament Simulator

A Python script to simulate MMA-style tournament matchups based on weight classes and age groups. Fighters are entered with basic info, grouped into brackets, and matched manually — with medals awarded based on wins.

🚀 Features
 Weight Class Assignment (Flyweight to Heavyweight)
 Age Group Division (Under 16, Under 18, 18+)
 Smart grouping of fighters into brackets (default: 5 per group)
 Medals awarded based on performance (Gold, Silver, Bronze)
 Ranked results for the entire tournament
 How It Works
Input Fighters: Name, weight, age, training experience, and fight history
Auto Classification: Fighters are classified by age group and weight class
Bout Simulation: Fighters in each group fight up to 4 matches, winners entered manually
Medal Distribution: Top 3 in each group receive medals
Final Ranking: All fighters are listed by total wins and losses
